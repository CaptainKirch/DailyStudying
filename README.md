🧠 Daily Algorithm + Python Syntax Practice
Welcome to my personal repo where I document daily progress toward mastering algorithmic problem solving and Python fluency.

This isn’t a bootcamp. This isn’t some tutorial walkthrough. This is structured deep work — grinding through patterns, rebuilding syntax from memory, and building real speed under pressure. I’m using this repo to sharpen the two most fundamental technical skills: problem solving and clean Python execution.

💡 Why This Exists
I believe the ability to solve hard problems quickly — and express solutions cleanly in code — is the single most important skill in modern software and AI work. This repo is where I train that skill every day.

The goal isn’t just to “learn algorithms” or “review syntax.” The goal is fluency — to get to a point where the logic and code flow without second-guessing. Whether I’m debugging a graph traversal or writing a CLI tool in pure Python, I want to operate fast and with precision.

🔁 What I Practice Daily
Here’s what a typical daily session looks like:

Solve 2–4 algorithm problems from curated pattern sets (NeetCode, LeetCode, Grokking)

Re-solve one problem from memory with no notes

Drill Python syntax patterns (e.g., list comprehensions, lambda functions, error handling)

Write one small script using a topic I’m reviewing (e.g., argparse, os, collections)

Push clean code + explanations to this repo

🧱 Core Areas of Focus
📦 Python Execution Fluency
Writing idiomatic, bug-free code from memory

Refactoring for clarity and simplicity

Understanding deeper Python behavior (mutability, closures, unpacking, etc.)

🧠 Algorithmic Thinking
Internalizing common patterns: sliding window, two pointers, recursion, trees, graphs

Solving medium-level problems consistently in <30 minutes

Breaking down problems clearly before jumping into code

🔬 Edge Cases + Testing
Manually generating test cases

Using pytest for reproducible unit testing

Building muscle memory around off-by-one, null input, and edge input handling

🏁 Long-Term Outcomes
Become fluent in solving algorithmic problems from scratch

Internalize the 20–30 most common coding patterns used in interviews and AI work

Write Python code that’s modular, clean, testable, and fast

Build a body of work that reflects actual thinking — not tutorial mimicry

If you’re grinding too, feel free to explore the patterns, scripts, or tests. This repo is built as much for future me as for anyone else who wants to level up in public.

Let’s build skill, not just code.
